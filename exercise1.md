I chose Python to discuss in this exercise.
Python have various linters, Pylint is used to check code for both logical and style related issues, also Pylint can detect different code smells. Coding style is checked to match PEP8. Pylint includes quite extensive error detection and IDE integration. Pylint is critizized for being slow and can be hard to configure. There are linters available which combine multiple different linters for example Flake8 and Pylama.
Python standard library unittest can be used for testing it has great documentation. Doctest module can be used for simpler tests, test cases are defined inside the function to be tested with docstring. Test tool with a simple syntax is py.test this is a full feature testing tool with simple syntax and great documentation.
Pure Python doesn't need a build tool for the code to be able run, but build tool is important for running the code in CI server for testing. PyBuilder can be used with Python for automatic unit and integration tests per build. Analysing the code coverage.
Travis CI is a alternative continuous integration tool for Gihub and Bitbucket projects, Travis CI is a hosted CI solution. It is easy to configure and take into use. Gitlab offers a CI solution which is widely used. Gitlab is meant function as a centralized CI solution which offers full CI/CD capabilities and does not rely on other external tools.
When there is a need for complicated CI setups or otherwise there is a need to access CI configurations deeply then self-hosted service is a better solution. Simple solutions for pipelines and fast launching then cloud based services are more suitable. Also pricing should be taken into consideration when evaluating the overall solution.
